I am a second year PhD at the school of [Electronic Engineering and Computer Science](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) at Queen Mary University of London. Supervised by [Dr. Qianni Zhang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=XR6C9BoAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Greg Slabaugh](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/) and [Dr. Christos Bourantas](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=rQn8RpgAAAAJ&hl=en)

My current research focus is the segmentation of cardiac structures using polygon-based approaches. More broadly I am interested in:
1. Graph neural networks
2. 3D reconstruction from 2D Image
3. Point- and dense-based contour representations
4. Differentiable polygonization / rasterization


Outside of the lab, I run long distance, I (attempt to) play chess, and enjoy plants and all things hilly / green.
